Common Workflow Language
========================

The Common Workflow Language is a set of free and open standards for describing
command-line tool and workflows made from those tool descriptions.

Every OpenMS tool from version 3.2 onwards can self-generate a CWL tool description
using the `-write_cwl` option.

For example: `PeakPickerHiRes -write_cwl PeakPickerHiRes.cwl`
