        Free, open source, desktop app. An analytics platform with workflow editor and a nice drag-and-drop user interface.
        Very interactive and has built-in nodes for related tasks like working with chemical structures, databases, machine learning, scripting. Distributed computing is best achieved with a KNIME server (License required) which also allows user management
        and a web interface to interact with workflows. In KNIME you can easily construct your own workflows or just download our
        ready-made creations for the most common analysis tasks.

        Script/DSL-based workflow language, executor and utilities (such as the browser based launcher and supervisor nf-tower). Automatically runs on various different cloud (AWS, Google, ...) and HPC environments (SLURM, LFS, Kubernetes, ...). It is recommended to use our ready-made nf-core compatible workflows for ease of use via the browser-based configuration and launcher.
