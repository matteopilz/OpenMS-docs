## Ready-made KNIME workflows

You can get ready-made KNIME workflows and workflow components with OpenMS nodes from our
[community hub](https://hub.knime.com/openms-team>).
You can easily drag-and-drop workflows into your opened KNIME analytics platform.
For more, e.g., thirdparty OpenMS workflows use the search bar on the hub and search for
["openms"](https://hub.knime.com/search?q=openms).


## Installing KNIME and creating workflows

Read through a introduction to OpenMS in KNIME [user tutorial](/tutorials/knime-user-tutorial.md) containing hands-on training material covering also basic
usage of KNIME and how to install it. See the official [KNIME Getting Started Guide](https://www.knime.com/getting-started-guide) for a more in-depth view of
the KNIME functionality besides OpenMS.

If you face any issues, please [contact us](/about/communication.md) and specifically for the usage of OpenMS in KNIME, the KNIME community contribution [forum](https://forum.knime.com/tag/openms).
