Introduction
============

OpenMS offers a wide range of tools you can use for your mass spectrometry analysis.
Users without programming experience or those who want to quickly run common pipelines and analyses on their data can check out our webapps.

Those who want to have more control over the settings in their pipeline can pick a pre-defined workflow or create a new one themselves with one
of our supported workflow systems.

If you want to develop high performance pipelines including a large amount of data, you can use our TOPP
tools either in the command line or create a new Nextflow workflow.

Should you be missing something you can also add new functions or classes to the OpenMS C++ core library.
