KNIME - A minimal workflow
==========================

Let us start with the creation of a simple workflow. As a first step, we will gather some basic
information about the data set before starting the actual development of a data analysis workflow. This minimal workflow
can also be used to check if all requirements are met and that your system is compatible.

- Create a new workflow.
- Add an `File Importer` node and an `Output Folder` node (found in **Community Nodes** > **GenericKnimeNodes** > **IO**)
  and a `FileInfo` node (to be found in the category **Community Node** > **OpenMS** > **File Handling**)  to the workflow.
- Connect the File Importer node to the FileInfo node, and the first output port of the FileInfo node to the Output Folder
  node.

```{tip}
In case you are unsure about which node port to use, hovering the cursor over the port in question will display the port
name and what kind of input it expects.
```
The complete workflow is shown in below image. `FileInfo` can produce two different kinds of output files.

- All nodes are still marked red, since we are missing an actual input file. Double-click the File Importer node and select
  **Browse**. In the file system browser [select](https://abibuilder.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/archive/openms/Tutorials/Example_Data/Introduction/datasets/tiny/velos005614.mzML) {path}`Example_Data,Introduction,datasets,tiny,velos005614.mzML`
  and click **Open**. Afterwards close the dialog by clicking **Ok**.

- The `File Importer` node and the `FileInfo` node should now have switched to yellow, but the `Output Folder` node is still red.
  Double-click on the `Output Folder` node and click on **Browse** to select an output directory for the generated data.
- Great! Your first workflow is now ready to be run. Press <kbd>&uarr;</kbd> + <kbd>F7</kbd> (shift key + F7; or the
  button with multiple green triangles in the KNIME Toolbar) to execute the complete workflow. You can also right click
  on any node of your workflow and select <kbd>Execute</kbd> from the context menu.
- The traffic lights tell you about the current status of all nodes in your workflow. Currently running tools show either
  a progress in percent or a moving blue bar, nodes waiting for data show the small word “queued”, and successfully
  executed ones become green. If something goes wrong (e.g., a tool crashes), the light will become red.
- In order to inspect the results, you can just right-click the Output Folder node and select **View: Open the output folder**
  You can then open the text file and inspect its contents.  You will find some basic information of the data contained
  in the mzML file, e.g., the total number of spectra and peaks, the RT and m/z range, and how many MS1 and MS2 spectra
  the file contains.

Workflows are typically constructed to process a large number of files automatically. As a simple example, consider you
would like to filter multiple mzML files to only include MS1 spectra. We will now modify the workflow to compute the
same information on three different files and then write the output files to a folder.

- We start from the previous workflow.
- First we need to replace our single input file with multiple files. Therefore we add the `Input Files` node from the
  category **Community Nodes** > **GenericKnimeNodes** > **IO**.
- To select the files we double-click on the `Input Files` node and click on **Add**. In the filesystem browser we select
  all three files from the [directory](https://abibuilder.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/archive/openms/Tutorials/Example_Data/Introduction/datasets/tiny) **Example_Data** > **Introduction** > **datasets** > **tiny**. And close the dialog
  with **Ok**.
- We now add two more nodes: the `ZipLoopStart` and the `ZipLoopEnd` node from the category
  **Community Nodes** > **GenericKnimeNodes* > **Flow** and replace the `FileInfo` node with `FileFilter` from  **Community Nodes** > **OpenMS** > **File Handling**.
- Afterwards we connect the `Input Files` node to the first port of the `ZipLoopStart` node, the first port of the `ZipLoopStart`
  node to the **FileConverter** node, the first output port of the **FileConverter** node to the first input port of the
  `ZipLoopEnd` node, and the first output port of the `ZipLoopEnd` node to the `Output Folder` node.

The complete workflow is shown in the top right of the figure below.

|Figure 9: The FileFilter workflow. Showing the configure dialog for `FileFilter`, and the level selector pane.

Now we need to configure the `FileFilter` to only store MS1 data. To do this we double click on the `FileFilter` node to open the configuration dialog (see left pane above), double click "level", select 2
from the sub-pane (see bottom right panel above), and click delete. Repeat the process for 3. Select OK to exit the sub-pane, and then OK again in the configuration dialog.

Execute the workflow and inspect the output as before.

Now, if you open the resulting files in TOPPView, you can see that only the MS1 spectra remain.

In case you had trouble to understand what `ZipLoopStart` and `ZipLoopEnd` do, here is a brief explanation:

- The `Input Files` node passes a list of files to the `ZipLoopStart` node.
- The `ZipLoopStart` node takes the files as input, but passes the single files sequentially (that is: one after the other)
  to the next node.
- The `ZipLoopEnd` collects the single files that arrive at its input port. After all files have been processed, the collected
  files are passed again as file list to the next node that follows.

## Advanced topic: Metanodes

Workflows can get rather complex and may contain dozens or even hundreds of nodes. KNIME provides a simple way to
improve handling and clarity of large workflows:

**Metanodes** allow to bundle several nodes into a single **Metanode**.

<div class="admonition task">
  <p class="admonition-title task title">**Task**</p>
  Select multiple nodes (e.g. all nodes of the **ZipLoop** including the start and end node). To select a set of nodes, draw a rectangle around them with the left mouse button or hold <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> to add/remove single nodes from the selection.
  <div class="admonition tip">
    <p class="admonition-title">**Tip**</p>
    There is a **Select Scope** option when you right-click a node in a loop, that does exactly that for you. Then, open the
    context menu (right-click on a node in the selection) and select **Create Metanode**. Enter a caption for the **Metanode**.
    The previously selected nodes are now contained in the **Metanode**. Double-clicking on the **Metanode** will display
    the contained nodes in a new tab window.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="admonition task">
<p class="admonition-title task-title">**Task**</p>
Create the Metanode to let it behave like an encapsulated single node. First select the **Metanode**, open the context
menu (right-click) and select **Metanode** > **Convert to Component**. The differences between Metanodes and components
are marginal (Metanodes allow exposing user inputs, workflow variables and contained nodes). Therefore, we suggest to use standard
Metanodes to clean up your workflow and cluster common subparts until you actually notice their limits.

<div class="admonition task">

Undo the packaging. First select the **Metanode/Component**, open the context menu (right-click) and select **Metanode/Component** > **Expand**.
