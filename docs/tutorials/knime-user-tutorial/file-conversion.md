Data conversion
===============

Each MS instrument vendor has one or more formats for storing the acquired data.
Converting these data into an open format (preferably mzML) is the very first step
when you want to work with open-source mass spectrometry software. A freely available conversion tool is MSConvert, which is part of a `ProteoWizard` installation. All files
used in this tutorial have already been converted to mzML by us, so you do not need
to perform the data conversion yourself. However, we provide a small raw file so you
can try the important step of raw data conversion for yourself.

```{note}
The OpenMS installation package for Windows automatically installs
ProteoWizard, so you do not need to download and install it separately. Due
to restrictions from the instrument vendors, file format conversion for most
formats is only possible on Windows systems. In practice, performing the
conversion to mzML on the acquisition PC connected to the instrument is
usually the most convenient option.
```

To convert raw data to mzML using `ProteoWizard` you can either use MSConvertGUI (a
graphical user interface) or `msconvert` (a simple command line tool).

|Figure 1: `MSConvertGUI` (part of `ProteoWizard`), allows converting raw files to mzML. Select the raw files you want to convert by clicking on the browse button and then on Add. Default parameters can usually be kept as-is. To reduce the initial data size, make sure that the `peakPicking` filter (converts profile data to centroided data (see <a href="#figure-2">Fig. 2</a>)) is listed, enabled (true) and applied to all MS levels (parameter ”1-”). Start the conversion process by clicking on the Start button.|

Both tools are available in: {{ '{path}'+'`C:,Program Files,OpenMS-{0},share,OpenMS,THIRDPARTY,pwiz-bin`'.format(version) }}.

You can find a small RAW file on the USB stick {path}`Example_Data,Introduction,datasets,raw`.

##### MSConvertGUI

`MSConvertGUI` (see <a href="#figure-1">Fig. 1</a>) exposes the main parameters for data conversion in a convenient graphical user interface.

##### msconvert

The `msconvert` command line tool has no graphical user interface but offers more options than the application `MSConvertGUI`. Additionally, since it can be used within a batch script, it allows converting large numbers of files and can be much more easily automatized.
To convert and pick the file `raw_data_file.RAW` you may write:

```bash
msconvert raw_data_file.RAW --filter "peakPicking true 1-"
```

in your command line.

|Figure 2: The amount of data in a spectra is reduced by peak picking. Here a profile spectrum (blue) is converted to centroided data (green). Most algorithms from this point on will work with centroided data.|

To convert all RAW files in a folder may write:

```bash
msconvert *.RAW -o my_output_dir
```

```{note}
To display all options you may type `msconvert --help` . Additional information is available on the `ProteoWizard` web page.
```

##### ThermoRawFileParser

Recently the open-source platform independent ThermoRawFileParser tool has been developed. While Proteowizard and MSConvert are only available for Windows systems this new tool allows to also convert raw data on Mac or Linux.
